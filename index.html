  <h1>Pig Dice</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Pig is a simple dice game which in its basic form is playable with just a single die. You win by being the first player to score 100 or more points.</li>
    <li> The first player throws a die and scores as many points as the total shown on the die providing the die doesnâ€™t roll a 1. The player may continue rolling and accumulating points (but risk rolling a 1) or end his turn.</li>
    <li>If the player rolls a 1 his turn is over, he loses all points he accumulated that turn, and he passes the die to the next player.
    </li>
    <li>Play passes from player to player until a winner is determined.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>First Player to 100 wins!!!</p>
